# project_2
This project involves training an image recognition model using Teachable Machine by Google to classify facial expressions into two categories: Happy and Sad. The trained model is exported in TensorFlow (Keras) format and used in a Google Colab notebook with a custom Python script to load the model and make predictions on input images.
#  Objectives
Train an image classifier with at least two classes (Happy and Sad).

Write a Python script to:

Load the trained model.

Accept an input image.

Predict the emotion (Happy or Sad).

# Tools & Technologies
Teachable Machine by Google
Google Colab

# How to Use
Upload the Model Files:

Upload keras_model.h5 and labels.txt to your Colab environment or project directory.

Upload an Image:

Upload an image you want to classify (like: Happy6.jpg).

Run the Python Script in Google Colab
