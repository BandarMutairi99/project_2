# project_2
This project involves training an image recognition model using Teachable Machine by Google to classify facial expressions into two categories: Happy and Sad. The trained model is exported in TensorFlow (Keras) format and used in a Google Colab notebook with a custom Python script to load the model and make predictions on input images.
